# Coding4Integrity_SecureProcure

Welcome to the Coding4Integrity_SecureProcure repository!

## About

This repository contains Insp3ctors' solution for secure and transparent public procurement. We have built a comprehensive platform that addresses various aspects of procurement, including a web platform, blockchain integration, and an AI model.

## Components

Our solution consists of three main components:

1. **Web Platform**: Our user-friendly web interface allows procurement professionals to efficiently manage and track the procurement process. It provides features such as document management, vendor evaluation, and real-time collaboration.

2. **Blockchain Integration**: We leverage blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of the procurement process. This component records all transactions and contract details on the blockchain, providing an immutable and auditable ledger.

3. **AI Model**: Our AI-powered model assists in decision-making and risk assessment throughout the procurement lifecycle. It offers predictive analytics, supplier recommendations, and anomaly detection to optimize procurement outcomes.
